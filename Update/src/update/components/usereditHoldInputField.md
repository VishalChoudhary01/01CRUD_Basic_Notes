Absolutely! Let's walk through the process in **more detail**, step by step, with some concrete values and explain **what happens behind the scenes** when you click on "Edit" and how the input fields hold particular user values.

### **The Scenario:**
You have a form where a user can either:
- **Add a new user** with their name and address.
- **Edit an existing user's data**.

When you click the "Edit" button next to a user's data, the goal is for the input fields to hold the values of that specific user (name and address). 

Let's say we have the following users in our `userData` state:

```js
[
  { id: 1, userName: "John Doe", address: "123 Main St" },
  { id: 2, userName: "Jane Smith", address: "456 Oak St" }
]
```

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

#### 1. **Initial State Setup**:

```js
const [userData, setUserData] = useState([
  { id: 1, userName: "John Doe", address: "123 Main St" },
  { id: 2, userName: "Jane Smith", address: "456 Oak St" }
]);
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  userName: "",
  address: "",
});
const [isEditting, setEditting] = useState(null);
```

- `userData` contains a list of users, each with `id`, `userName`, and `address`.
- `formData` holds the values that are entered into the input fields. Initially, both `userName` and `address` are empty.
- `isEditting` is `null` initially, meaning no user is being edited.

### 2. **Clicking the "Edit" Button**:

Letâ€™s say you click the **"Edit"** button next to the **"Jane Smith"** user, whose `id` is `2`.

#### **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
- **The `handleEdit` function is triggered** with the `id` of the user you want to edit (in this case, `2`).
  
```js
const handleEdit = (id) => {
  const userToEdit = userData.find((user) => user.id === id);  // Find the user by ID
  setFormData({
    userName: userToEdit.userName,  // "Jane Smith"
    address: userToEdit.address,    // "456 Oak St"
  });
  setEditting(id);  // Set isEditting to the user's ID
};
```

- The function will **search for the user with `id` equal to `2`** in the `userData` array using `find()`.
- In this case, the user found is: `{ id: 2, userName: "Jane Smith", address: "456 Oak St" }`.
- `setFormData` is then called to update the state with the `userName` and `address` values of **Jane Smith**. 

So, after `handleEdit` runs:
- `formData` will be updated to:
  ```js
  formData = {
    userName: "Jane Smith",
    address: "456 Oak St"
  }
  ```
  
- The input fields are **controlled components** (i.e., they derive their values from `formData`). Therefore, they will now **display "Jane Smith"** and **"456 Oak St"** inside the respective fields.

- `isEditting` is set to `2` (the `id` of the user being edited), which will change the text of the submit button to "Update" (indicating that you're editing an existing user).

#### **What Happens in the UI**:
- The "Edit" button is clicked for **Jane Smith**. 
- The form inputs (for `userName` and `address`) are now populated with **"Jane Smith"** and **"456 Oak St"**.
- The submit button will change to **"Update"** because you're now editing an existing user (not adding a new one).

### 3. **Editing and Updating the Form**:

Let's say you update the name and address in the form. 

#### **Example**:
You change the **name** to `"Jane Johnson"` and the **address** to `"789 Pine St"`.

- Now, when you submit the form by clicking **"Update"**, the `handleSubmit` function is triggered.

```js
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();  // Prevent form from refreshing the page

  if (isEditting !== null) {  // If we're editing an existing user
    setUserData((prevData) => 
      prevData.map((user) =>
        user.id === isEditting ? { ...user, ...formData } : user
      )
    );
    setEditting(null);  // Reset isEditting after update
  } else {  // If we're adding a new user
    setUserData((prevData) => [
      ...prevData,
      { ...formData, id: user_id },
    ]);
  }

  // Clear the form after submission
  setFormData({
    userName: "",
    address: "",
  });
};
```

- **If `isEditting` is not `null`**, we are in the "editing" mode. 
  - We use `map()` to **update the user** whose `id` matches `isEditting` (which is `2` in this case).
  - `setUserData` updates the user with the new `userName` and `address` from `formData`:
  
    So, the `userData` array will now look like this:
    ```js
    [
      { id: 1, userName: "John Doe", address: "123 Main St" },
      { id: 2, userName: "Jane Johnson", address: "789 Pine St" }
    ]
    ```

- **After updating**, we reset `isEditting` to `null`, which means the form is no longer in "edit" mode.
- Finally, we **clear the form fields** by resetting `formData` to empty values.

### 4. **Result**:
- The input fields are now cleared (because we reset `formData`), and you can either add a new user or edit another user.
- The **"Update"** button will return to **"Create User"** because `isEditting` is now `null`.

### **Visualization with Example Values**:

#### Initial `userData`:

```js
[
  { id: 1, userName: "John Doe", address: "123 Main St" },
  { id: 2, userName: "Jane Smith", address: "456 Oak St" }
]
```

#### After Clicking "Edit" for Jane Smith (`id: 2`):

- `handleEdit` finds Jane Smith and updates `formData` to:
  
  ```js
  formData = {
    userName: "Jane Smith",
    address: "456 Oak St"
  }
  ```

- Input fields now show:

  - **User Name**: "Jane Smith"
  - **Address**: "456 Oak St"

- The submit button text changes to **"Update"** because `isEditting` is now set to `2`.

#### After Editing and Clicking "Update":

- You modify the inputs to:
  - **User Name**: "Jane Johnson"
  - **Address**: "789 Pine St"
  
- When the form is submitted, `handleSubmit`:
  - Updates the user data in `userData` to:
  
    ```js
    [
      { id: 1, userName: "John Doe", address: "123 Main St" },
      { id: 2, userName: "Jane Johnson", address: "789 Pine St" }
    ]
    ```

- The form clears (because `formData` is reset to empty values), and the **button text** changes back to **"Create User"**.

### **Summary of Key Steps**:
1. **Clicking "Edit"**:
   - Finds the user to edit based on `id`.
   - Updates `formData` with the user's current data (`userName` and `address`).
   - The input fields are updated with that user's values.

2. **Editing and Submitting the Form**:
   - If `isEditting` is not `null`, we update the user data in `userData` with the new values from `formData`.
   - The form is cleared after submission.

3. **Why Inputs Hold Specific User's Data**:
   - The inputs are **controlled components**, meaning their `value` is directly tied to the `formData` state.
   - When `formData` is updated (e.g., with the selected user's data), React re-renders the inputs with the new values.

This is the core logic behind **clicking "Edit"** and **updating** the user data while holding the particular values in the input fields.
